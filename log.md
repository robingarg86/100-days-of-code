# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Saturday, 17 November, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started [Udemy iOS Course](https://www.udemy.com/ios-12-app-development-bootcamp/learn/v4/overview). Environment setup, tools installed.

**Thoughts:** Today didn't do much coding part.

### Day 2: Sunday, 18 November, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Interface builder. Created simple single view app I am Rich and completed Coading Challenge I am Poor

**Thoughts:** As i am experienced iOS developer so found this work very very simple for me.
